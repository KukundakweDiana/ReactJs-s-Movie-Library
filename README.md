This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Online-Movie-Library-in-ReactJs

This repository has all the code i am using to create an online Movie Library using ReactJs. Inorder to follow along, you should have a basic understanding of how ReactJs is used and also, how to use APIS.
The ideal code editor in this case is VS Code. Make sure to have Node Js installed on your machine too.
Lets start at the top,this means we install Vs code editor from https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
Next, we will need to setup Node Js on our machines here https://www.guru99.com/download-install-node-js.html. This link will guide you through your installation.
Now, we are almost ready to start working with React. Let's find out some information about react from https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html. 
Now for creating a react App,https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app.
Here are some of the resources to guide you through the process of editing your app.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZvSYJDk-us&feature=youtu.be , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A. 

Here is what we are going to do:
>>My Movie Library is an online library where users can freely add their favorite movies and view all of them at a glance.

1. Users can create a movie.
2. Users can view all the movies in the library.
3. Users can view a single movie in the library.

Optional Features ( Good to have)
1. Users can modify a movie in the library.
2. Users can delete a specific movie in the library.
Once the front end design of this is complete(with CSS too), we shall consume the Movie library API found at this link https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5531020/SWLiaS2b?version=latest
Once everything is said and done, in the terminal navigate to where your app is saved on your machine and run "yarn start" or "npm start" depending on what package manager you are using.
